# Countdown

The Countdown occurs at approximately 8:59 PM and is a time for members to gather around.

To initiate the Countdown, gather organizers and members around the front of the room. At `f~f~f|0`, start counting until `f~f~f|f`. Once the Countdown ends, announce that [Checkpoints](/events/hack-o-clock/checkpoints.md) will begin immediately after.

**It is very important that the Countdown happens every canonical Hack O'Clock, as it is an integral part of the event.**
