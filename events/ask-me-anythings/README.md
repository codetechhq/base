# ask-me-anythings

Ask-Me-Anythings (AMAs) are live Q\&A sessions where a guest joins CodeTech to share their experience and take questions. These are usually virtual and feature industry professionals, CodeTech alumni, or anyone the community finds valuable.

## preparation

1. **Find someone worth hearing from.** Could be someone already supporting us or someone members respect.
2. **Reach out.** Get in touch and ask if they’re open to doing an AMA.
3. **Lock down time, format, and cost.** Sort out the schedule. If in-person, figure out logistics. If remote, confirm cost (if any) and make sure it fits the budget.
4. **Promote it.** Post on socials, drop it in Discord, make a flyer if needed—make noise.
5. **Set up the meet link.** Use Google Meet. Share it with the speaker and confirm they know how to use it.


## before the event

* Prepare solid questions in advance.
* Create a dedicated Discord channel for submissions.
* Pre-select attendees to ask questions live—helps keep quality high and the session focused.
* Share the Meet link in Discord and begin recording before the event starts.
* Ensure everyone except the speaker is muted and cameras are off. Keeps the recording clean.
* Optionally, write a day-of run sheet so everything flows.

## during the event

1. **Intro the speaker.** 1-2 hosts should kick things off. Intro CodeTech, the speaker, and themselves. Ask the first question.
2. **Stay ahead.** Have an organizer DM the next question-asker while the current one is talking.
3. **Student asks.** Bring the student on. Unmute them, make sure their video’s on, and that they stay sharp and concise.
4. **Repeat.** Cycle through the prepped questions until they run out or time’s up.
5. *Optional:* If time allows, open up for audience Q\&A. Moderate heavily.
6. **Wrap.** Thank the speaker and end the call.
7. **Archive.** Download the recording and queue it for editing + publishing.
