# base

Base is the knowledgebase for CodeTech Members. It is a collection of resources, guides, and documentation, which are updated constantly as we speak now.

Base is for:

- Current members & organizers of CodeTech to access our values and practices in one place
- Future members & organizers of CodeTech to understand the history of the org and build on top of it with greater context & intention
- Student org leaders at other schools who want to build more resilient orgs
- Anyone who wants to gain a deep understanding of what CodeTech does


## Why does Base exist?

CodeTech has been around since 2024, but very little of the first year of its history was ever written down and has been lost to time. This made CodeTech members require constant reinvention from each generation of leadership, who could not learn from past mistakes & successes or build on top of previous values.

We believe that documentation is a core component of the solid foundation required to build resilient orgs.

> There is a mind game that is played when the current leader of an org looks to what their org did in previous years and attempts to repeat it without understanding it, thereby watering it down.
> 
> This mind game is caused by weak and/or uninspired leadership, and is generally a sign that the org will degrade or fail to meaningfully move forward. Too many years of Telephone will send an org barreling toward dark ages, establishing a Current that becomes very difficult to change.
> 
> This mind game is exceedingly common in student orgs, which have high turnover rates and no full-time leadership. It’s almost inevitable that every student org will suffer from this problem at least once in its life, even if it is very strong at one point.


But good documentation is hard:

> Creating and maintaining up-to-date documentation is something most orgs—not just student orgs—are bad at. It’s often lower priority because it’s not an immediate need, and the activation energy required to do it right is too high when it is needed. Student orgs are especially bad at this for the same reason they’re especially vulnerable to collapse.

Base is our attempt to ensure CodeTech org continues for the next 100 years and beyond. We also hope it can serve as inspiration for other student orgs who want their orgs to last just as long.


## What is (and is not) in Base

Types of things commonly included in Base:

- Values and opinions
- Information about internal operations, e.g. team structure and programs
- Recaps/writeups/postmortems of individual events
- Technical guides, e.g. for designing & laser cutting Knights badges
- Information about internal infrastructure
- Design docs & RFCs for technical projects


Documentation containing potentially sensitive information, such as meeting notes and information about individual members, are also part of the Base project, but instead stored in a private repository called `mistral-11`, with access given only to Organizers & Knights Bishops. That said, *Base is an open-source first initiative;* everything is stored in this public repository unless there’s a good reason not to.

## How we update Base

Anyone who feels they have something to contribute, including current members, organizers, and alumni, are encouraged to open a pull request to this repository with their contributions.

Base is an open source effort, and we need your help. The Issues tab of this repository serves as a wishlist for things we would like to add to Base.

Internally, Base is viewed as a best-effort continuous improvement project. We prioritize overall coverage over thoroughness. Culturally, everyone from members to organizers are encouraged & expected to contribute a document to Base when they facilitate something within the org.
