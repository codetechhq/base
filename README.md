# base ðŸ”¥

**Base** is the knowledge hub for CodeTech members. Itâ€™s where we document how things work, why they work that way, and how weâ€™ve made decisions in the past. Itâ€™s updated actively.

Base is for:

* Current CodeTech members and organizers to access values, systems, and practices
* Future members and organizers to build with context instead of starting from scratch
* Student org leaders looking to run stronger, more resilient orgs
* Anyone curious about how CodeTech operates at its core


## why base exists

CodeTech started in 2024. Like most orgs, we didnâ€™t document much in the beginning. That led to a patternâ€”each new group of leaders had to reinvent what already existed, often without knowing what worked, what didnâ€™t, or why.

Weâ€™re fixing that.

Documentation is infrastructure. Without it, strong orgs weaken fast. Leaders try to repeat past work without context, copying surface-level efforts that no longer serve a purpose. Thatâ€™s how an org loses momentum.

> Student orgs are especially vulnerableâ€”high turnover, no full-time leadership, and little time to reflect. If no one writes things down, youâ€™re stuck repeating the same mistakes.

We built Base so CodeTech doesnâ€™t fall into that trap. Itâ€™s here to keep the org sharp, adaptive, and alignedâ€”year after year.


## what base includes (and doesnâ€™t)

What youâ€™ll find in Base:

* Core values and beliefs
* Internal operations: how weâ€™re structured and what we run
* Event recaps and postmortems
* Technical guides and how-tos
* Infra documentation and processes
* Design docs and project RFCs

Some docsâ€”like internal notes or anything tied to individual membersâ€”live in a separate private repo: `mistral-11`, with limited access. But by default, Base is open-source. If thereâ€™s no strong reason to keep it private, it goes here.


## how we maintain base

Base runs on contributions. If youâ€™ve done something, learned something, or documented something, open a PR.

Every member, organizer, and alumni is encouraged to write. If you ran a session, organized an event, or built a toolâ€”document it. The goal isnâ€™t perfection, itâ€™s coverage.

Check the Issues tab for whatâ€™s missing or in progress. Base is built as we go.
